Navigating the dynamic landscape of mobile data plans in Nigeria can often feel challenging. With prices fluctuating and familiar bundles sometimes changing, securing affordable internet access, especially for significant usage, requires staying informed about the best MTN data plans available.

For users who are most active online during late hours, standard data plans can deplete quickly, leading to unexpected costs. Fortunately, MTN offers a solution tailored for night owls: the MTN Night Plan.

What is the MTN Night Plan?

The MTN Night Plan is a dedicated data bundle designed specifically for use during off-peak hours. Its key feature is providing discounted data rates exclusively between 11:00 PM and 6:00 AM daily.

This makes it an ideal option for individuals who engage in data-intensive activities like downloading large files, streaming videos, online gaming, or working late into the night.

MTN Night Plan 2025: Available Bundles & Current Pricing

In 2025, MTN has updated its Night Plan options. The previously available N25 for 250MB and N50 for 500MB plans are no longer active.

The current, primary Pulse Nightlife Bundle available is:

500MB for N75: This is the standard MTN Night Plan offer in 2025.

Need More Data? Stacking the Night Plan

For users requiring more than 500MB during the night, MTN allows multiple subscriptions to the 500MB Pulse Nightlife Bundle.

You can activate the N75 bundle up to four times within a single night (11 PM – 6 AM).

Calculation:

4 subscriptions x 500MB = 2GB

Total Cost:

4 subscriptions x N75 = N300

How to Subscribe: MTN Night Plan Code and Methods

Activating the MTN Night Plan is simple:

USSD Code: Dial *406# and follow the prompts.

MTN Website/App: Visit the official MTN Nigeria website or use the MyMTN app.

Migration to MTN Pulse

If you are currently on a different MTN tariff plan, you will need to migrate to MTN Pulse to access the Night Plan.

To migrate, simply dial *123# and follow the prompts.

Once you have successfully migrated to MTN Pulse, you can activate the Night Plan using the USSD code or MTN website/app.

The MTN Night Plan is an excellent option for users who need affordable internet access during late hours. With discounted data rates and flexible subscription options, it’s an ideal choice for night owls, gamers, and heavy internet users."
